# Craigslist
This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.

Using the craigslist python package, I scrape and categorize local apartment listings that fit my budget and e-mail myself new results every few hours. This eliminates the need to constantly check craigslist manually and scroll through the results for new postings.
